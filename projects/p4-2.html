    Assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    <h2>User feedback</h2>
                    <p>Find representative users for your design and bring them in for a user feedback session on your prototype. This should involve at least five different users. (If the nature of your design means that your user group is extremely difficult to connect with, coordinate with your studio staff to agree on a realistic goal.)</p>

                    <p>For each user, set the stage and make sure they understand that you are testing the prototype, not them. Lay out tasks or goals that they are trying to achieve, and let them interact with your prototype. Make sure one of your team members is taking notes and recording any relevant media (e.g., photos, video). Another team member should guide the process. Encourage the user to follow a think-aloud protocol — you likely learned this technique in CS 147. Try your absolute hardest not to intervene. Watching helplessly as someone struggles to use your interface is one of the hardest, but most valuable, things you can do.</p>

                    <p>Afterwards, it's time to synthesize. Convert your observations into sticky notes and start clustering them on a whiteboard. Identify themes, re-cluster, and discuss until your main reflections have settled.</p>

                    <p>Write up a brief report detailing your method, results, and reflections. You will inevitably notice usability improvements you should be making, but <strong>focus your analysis on ways in which your high-level design is or is not addressing users' needs</strong>.</p>

                    <p>Finally, sketch or mock your proposed redesign that you will be pursuing based on this feedback.</p>
