    Assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

We will look at individual submissions for the pieces of the project. If your project pivoted after a milestone was turned in, summarize the revised direction for each milestone in this final deliverable — it doesn't need to be as in-depth as the original milestone, but it should capture the main insights we sought with each milestone.</p>

                    <p>In addition, please prepare a short (~45-second) video of someone using the interface so that we have content for our records. It does not need to be carefully edited. If you made a video for your presentation, and it shows off the interface in detail, that is sufficient.</p>
