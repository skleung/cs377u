    Assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

               <div id="iterate" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Iterate</h2>
                    <p>Based on your feedback from your users and in your studio, iterate on your prototype. This is your last chance to pull out the stops!</p>

                    <p>Flesh out your prototype. Reflect on our lessons from the visual design component of class: start with visual information hierarchy, then think about grids, layout, negative space, color, fonts, and more. You should employ the techniques from P2 to guide your design process. This includes making thumbnail sketches, wireframes, mood boards, Sketch mocks, etc. Although there are no explicit deliverables around visual design, we expect that you will give it equal thought and consideration as interaction design. In fact, you’ll find that visual design and interaction design are often linked in creating a strong user interface.</p>

                    <p>Even at this final state, remember that it's a prototype and not a demo: it doesn't need to be complete. If you ever start talking about options or preferences or user logins, stop — you're not focusing on the right parts of the prototype. You can probably even fake most of the data in your application. We don't expect a live database. However, the prototype should be maturely designed now, so that expert external judges can experience the main interaction flow and how it addresses user needs.</p>

                    <p>Bring your prototype so you can show it off during the demo and poster session! The staff and judges will interact with it there. Prepare a user task or scenario (or maybe a small set of them) to run through on the prototype with visitors to your poster. Think in advance of how to demo your system with as little friction as possible.</p>

                <div id="pitch" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Pitch</h2>
                    <p>You need to come up with a forty five-second pitch to the audience. Make sure the listener leaves with an understanding of the user, their need, and how you are addressing it with your design. You are welcome to design your pitch however any way that you feel will be compelling. We will present your slide(s) behind you as you present, and will automatically go on to the next group after forty five seconds. Keep in mind that your audience are likely design experts.</p>

                    <p>We are inviting coaches and external judges to the final project presentations to give feedback and help decide the awards. The judges will be given a rubric much like the ones attached to this assignment and to P4-IV. They will be evaluating your presentation, poster, demo and design concept via a rubric.</p>

                    <p>Look below for details on how to submit your presentation materials.</p>

                <div id="poster" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Poster</h2>
                    <p>You will need a <b>20"x30"</b> poster to tell judges about your project. This is a chance to show off your visual design skills. A common error is to put too much content on the poster. Keep it simple and convey the main concept. It should be geared towards pitching your project to viewers/judges — the user, the need, and the design concept — and not about your iterative process. We will provide easels; you will need to print out and mount your poster on a stiff backing so that it can stand alone on the easel. Posters can be printed at <a href="https://acomp.stanford.edu/techlounge/posters">Lathrop</a>, <a href="http://www.costcophotocenter.com/Shop/Posters#/PosterBoards/posterboard/20x30">Costco($25)</a> or <a href="http://photo.walgreens.com/walgreens/info1/isfrom=_walgreens_posterscreateflow">Walgreens ($24)</a>. They usually have a 1-2 day turnaround. You can order online and pick it up from the store.</p>

                            <li>A slide (<b>16:9 aspect ratio, .png</b>) to be projected behind you as you give your pitch.</li>
