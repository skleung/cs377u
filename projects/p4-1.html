    Assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    <p>Get something that's moving. It's not going to be perfect. But it will comprise the central interaction of your design in code, and nothing more. Don't make it pretty. Don't try to build out the whole idea. Keep it lightweight. Feel free to Wizard of Oz components that you will later implement. Fake any data or user accounts — don't build any back end code if you can avoid it. If you've focused your question correctly, your functional prototype will convey the most important aspect of the experience that you are envisioning, and nothing else.</p>

                    <p>The central goal of this milestone is to arrive at something that you and the staff agree has captured the core idea well and will be suitable for user testing. We strongly recommend iterating on this milestone in studio at least once, meaning that you submit something, get feedback in studio, and submit again.</p>

                    <p>We expect that most teams will continue their final proposal from P3. You are welcome to pivot in consultation with your studio staff.</p>

Don't worry about editing it well, just capture the main idea. If your prototype is implemented for the web, we would strongly encourage you to include a link as well.</li>
                        <li><em>Optional</em>: One PDF with screenshots of your prototype. </li>
