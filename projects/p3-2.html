    Assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    <h2>Observation</h4>
                    <p>Execute on your needfinding plan and gather your observations. Capture a mix of sketches, text, and when appropriate, photo and video. Record audio (or video) from your interviews, with permission.</p>

                    <p>Compile your team's observations together into one PDF. Now, filter your raw materials into five pages of your most interesting observations that the course staff can look at, and copy them into another PDF, alongside a couple sentences each of explanation if you'd like. Print and bring these selections to studio.</p>

                    <p>The staff will be giving you feedback on your interview technique as part of this milestone. To do so, we need you to transcribe a ~3 minute clip of one of your interviews. Pick a 3-minute slice where you would like help digging deeper, and transcribe it out into a document. If you prefer to experience a paid industry option instead of transcribing it yourself, it would cost about $5 and require a 24-hour turnaround with <a href="https://www.rev.com/transcription">Rev</a>.</p>

                    <p><strong>Optional</strong> (your studio instructor will communicate if this step is required): Generate three people profiles to capture different stakeholders. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hBcZuyHrgmr3cjRwsgiKO3rwcz2z-xv963EBkSaDp3w/edit?usp=sharing">(See a template here that you can copy and edit for your submission.)</a> People profiles ensure that you have enough depth on a perspective from your conversations to tell a story. They help your results become more emotionally resonant.</p>

                <div id="interpretation" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Interpretation</h2>
                    <p>It's time to synthesize your needfinding results. Grab a whiteboard, and start by putting all your observations onto Post-It notes. Start grouping them, turning your raw observations into <em>interpretations</em> (recall lecture for details), and then regrouping as necessary. Aim to produce <em>needs</em>. Remember, needs are <em>verbs</em> (activities or desires that your user could use some help). They are not nouns (solutions). Don't restrict your focus to just  what people say and do, reflect also on what they think and feel. If you want a reminder of these terms and methods, check the needfinding lecture, or look at the <a href="http://dschool.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/BootcampBootleg2010v2SLIM.pdf">d.school Bootcamp Bootleg</a>. 

                    <p>Finally, translate your needs into <a href="http://dschool.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/HMW-METHODCARD.pdf">How Might We...?" questions</a>. Aim for at least ten.</p>

                    <p>Do not submit a raw dump of materials; rather, organize a subset of your most salient, insightful or inspiring observations and interpretations. Make sure to back up each interpretation and need with an observation, a quote or a picture.</p>

                    <h2>Submit</h2>
                    <p>Pull everything together into your submission for P3.II on Canvas. This includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>One PDF with your raw observations</li>
                        <li>One PDF with your transcribed 3-minute clip of the interview</li>
                        <li>One PDF with your selected observations with explanations</li>
                        <li>One PDF with your needfinding interpretations, needs, and "How Might We...?" questions</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Be prepared to describe the major observations, interpretations, needs and HMW questions in three to five minutes in studio. Bring printouts of your transcribed interview, selected observations, and of your needfinding interpretations+needs+how might we's with you to studio.</p>
