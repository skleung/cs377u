    Assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    <h2>Revised mock</h2>
                    <p>Reflect on the feedback you got on your mocks in studio. Try to understand what the feedback is intending, and â€¨why the staff are reacting to your designs the way they are. Write one paragraph reporting back the main idea of your critiques.</p>

                    <p>This is your chance to update your design based on the feedback. Remember, critiques aren't intended to just give you usability feedback; they aim to question deeper aspects of your design. If you think you can address the feedback with a different solution than the one the instructor or your peers suggested, go for it. However, it is your responsibility to address the critique with your revision.</p>

                    <p>Your end goal is to produce a revised  interactive (HTML) mock of the design. Start back in Sketch 3, and move to HTML when you have something you're happy with. When you're done, write a paragraph explaining how you aimed to address the critique (and any additional criteria you had) with your revision.</p>

                    <h4>Implement your portfolio</h4>
                    <p>Time to go live! Translate your mock into code using HTML and CSS, as well as Javascript if necessary. You are welcome to use any front-end web framework you want. However, we advise you to make the web site static: that is, it shouldn't require server software such as Rails, node.js, or PHP. Nearly any portfolio can be implemented using static HTML, CSS and Javascript. Getting a server framework in the loop will eat too much valuable time.</p>

                    <p>You can write and debug your site locally on your computer. We recommend using GitHub to track your commits as you work to help prevent data loss. <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/courses/cs147/2014/wi/lab/lab1/">Here's CS 147 2014's Source Control lab</a> in case you'd like some notes. When you're done, upload the site to a server so it goes live. <a href="https://itservices.stanford.edu/service/web/centralhosting/howto_user">Here's an explanation of how to get it on your Stanford web space.</a> Put a copy of all code in your submission Dropbox.</p>

                    <p>Keep in mind that, because everyone has a different design, we can't teach you all the HTML/JS/CSS tricks that will get you exactly the page you want. If you're unsure, use Google and StackOverflow to help guide you. You may find it helpful to leverage front-end toolkits such as <a href="http://www.getbootstrap.com">Twitter Bootstrap</a>. If you get stuck, try creating a <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/">JSFiddle</a> so others can see, or upload your current buggy version to the web. For the JSFiddle, you may need to host any images on a server for them to render. Then, feel free to ask your fellow students and the instructors for help on Piazza.</a>

                    <p>If you realize that your design is too ambitious to implement in its entirety, contact the staff with a mock showing exactly what you're proposing to implement as a scaled-back version and get their OK.</p>

                <div id="moodboard" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Create a mood board</h2>
                    <p>Now, it's time to focus in on a visual design style by collecting a mood board. Remember, a mood board must have a mood of some sort; it can't be just a collection of stuff you like. Example themes might be 1) soft watercolor art, 2) UNIX terminal, or 3) dominant use of negative space. Refer to lecture for more detail.</p>

                    <p>To create the mood board, collect concepts, photos, color swatches, illustrations, shapes, and anything else that conveys the identity you want to get across. Collect the ones you like into a page that is at least 8.5"x11". Powerpoint and Keynote should be plenty powerful for this purpose, but pick any digital layout tool you like.</p>

                    <p>There are two common errors that previous CS 247 students have made when creating mood boards. The first error is a mood board that has no clear concept behind it. A mood board must be more targeted than full web pages: it must be small clippings, headlines, images, and other very specific media that evoke your concept. The second error is that they don't communicate a single mood or concept. If you're going for a punk aesthetic, find pieces of media that feel punk!</p>

                <div id="pixel" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Pixel-perfect mocks</h2>
                    <p>Having explored the options, you are ready to refine and create pixel-perfect mocks that represent different instantiations of the visual style. We'll talk later in the class about why going for breadth with three different ideas is a good idea, but for now suffice it to say that an experienced designer would never walk into a meeting with only one concept. Your mocks should capture exactly what the application will look like when you implement the application using web technology. We recommend making these mocks in Sketch, because it is a far more fluid platform for messing with visual design.</p>

                    <p>Once you have three, and have gotten feedback on them, choose one to refine further into a final pixel-perfect mock.</p>
