    Assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    <!-- The first goal of P1 is to abandon a common error that new designers make: focusing on raw, surface-level description in needfinding. When students graduate from CS 147, typically their needfinding observations are still extremely surface-level (e.g., "It was loud, so we should find ways to make it quieter.") This time, the expectations are higher. We'll aim to turn those observations into focused needs.</p> -->

                    <p><b>Design requires communication.</b> The better your communication cuts to the core of the idea, the more effective you are as a designer. It's your responsibility to ensure that others see the same thing in your ideas that you do. If they see something else, you need to accept a <i>mea culpa</i>: there's something you're not communicating clearly. Visual communication is a kind of interface design: if the recipient doesn't rapidly get it, then the interface (communication) needs to be tweaked.</p>

                    <h4>Equip yourself</h4>
                    <p>A good drawing pad or sketchbook is a critical part of the designer's toolkit. Make sure you've purchased a pad and pen you can take with you. Act quickly, because we are not the only class on campus that's asking you to buy a sketchbook and they do sell out.Important features: <b>you must be able to easily tear out the pages</b> (so we can tape them on the walls), no lines, no flimsy pages, no tiny pages (we recommend at least 5"x8"), no thin-lined pens (go for something with a reasonably thick ink stream), and no pencils. The Stanford Bookstore sells drawing pads, as does <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/University+Art/@37.473066,-122.217582,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x808fbb3a2902b9fb:0x40d44f8e06f1dc56">University Art</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Accent+Arts/@37.426745,-122.144873,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x808fbae5939d8a8d:0x51810dd03fc0d3d1">Accent Arts</a>.

                    <h4>Sketching people and technology</h4>
                    <p>Using the techniques from lecture, start by capturing the following interfaces and interactions. Do each one at least three times &mdash; trying out different angles, styles, and techniques each time &mdash; and star your favorite one.</p>

                    <p>A key to this assignment is that sketches maximize clarity, not careful detail. Capturing the right details and knowing what to leave out is key to an effective sketch.</p>

                    <p>Draw big, and use half or entire pages for each sketch.</p>

                    <h4>Observe and sketch at your location</h4>
                    <p>Your studio instructor will give you a location to go observe and sketch at. Find your assigned studio in the list below.</p>

                    <p>Once you're at your location, walk around and observe. Take down some sketches to yourself of what you see. Aim to capture at volume, don't worry about filtering to just great observations. Focus on specific stories and details. For example, try telling the story of a single person or set of people at the location. Feel free to take pictures or audio recordings on your phone to complement for your own memory, but do not capture pictures and audio now and then sketch after the fact. You must sketch while you're there. 

                    <p>For this section, you are not graded on your needfinding skills, but instead on your use of visual communication techniques. In other words, are you capturing the important aspects of the environment? Can another designer understand what the situation was, or what you were trying to convey?</p>

                    <p>The deliverable here is a selection of no fewer than ten pages of your sketches, captured in a primarily visual form. Feel free to include other material as supplements at the end of the assignment submission &mdash; we will glance through them too.</p>

                    <p>If any of the deliverables are missing, we will reduce your score by 25% per deliverable.

What affects their behavior, are there any hesitations, confusions?</p>
										<p> <b>Option 2: Shared goals and individual preferences.</b> Find a restaurant, possibly with an order counter. An information desk/kiosk serving groups in a relatively public space would be fine too. Observe groups of people trying to order/find info together, and groups sitting down. Questions to get you started:  Do people need to 'negotiate'? What objects or people's own devices play a role? Do they use or adjust the space around them in some way, for example when they sit down?</p>

										<div><p><b>Where to go:</b> To get started with understanding needs in the home, do some observations in a graduate student’s home either on or off campus.The home must be an apartment, condo, or house and cannot be a dorm room. The home you observe must be a private home of some kind with it’s own kitchen and bathroom. Note that row housing like Synergy or La Casa Italiana is still considered dorms even if at some point they were private houses. <p>

										<p>	<b>How to do it:</b> Ask a graduate student friend (or friend-of-a-friend) if you can come hang out at their house for an hour, observe how they have it set up, and sketch how they go about their business. If they live with other people in the home ask if you can come at a time when more people are around and be a fly on the wall. Families, couples, or roommates are all great opportunities to observe how numerous people engage with their home and with each other. </p>
										
										<p><b>What to look for:</b> Sketch how things are set up at their house. Take note of what objects are located where and why they might be there. What the relationships between the things in the house and the people? What technologies do you see? What looks old? What looks new?  Does anything seem out of place? Intriguing? Mundane? Sketch what and who residents in the home interact with and what they might be feeling. Sketch storyboards of the interactions and vignettes that you see played out. Imagine that later you are going to use your sketches to help illustrate a storybook about what’s going on in this house and why. What would you draw to explain what your seeing to someone else visually?</p> </div>

Look how objects like the food being served influence the interactions. Pay particular attention to the emotional states of the clients and staff. Tell mini-stories of your observations.</p>

										<p><b>Option 3: Your choice.</b>
										Pick a real world situation of your choice. Make sure it is a location with a diverse set of clientele. Make sure you are safe. If it is not a public place, introduce yourselves and ask if it is ok to stay and sketch. Look for interactions/logistics/objects that bring a diverse set of people together or separate them emotionally. Tell small stories with your drawings. </p></div>

                    <h2>Grading rubric</h2>
                    <p>An important thing to keep in mind for this advanced class is that full credit is not automatic, nor very common. (There will of course be a curve at the end.) Nobody is perfect at design at first.</p>

                    <p>Remember that there are no unit tests for design. In the real world, evaluation is a subjective <i>but highly expert practice</i>. We ensure fair grading by having both the TA and the studio instructor, who has years of experience, review your submission.</p>
