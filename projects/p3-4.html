    Assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    <h2>Back to the field</h2>
                    <p>Remember that testing many can produce better insights than testing one. So, bring your three prototypes to at least four representative users out in the field. Think of this as <b>needfinding with props</b>.Ask your studio staff if you need help gaining access to users.</p>

                    <p>Set the stage — the user's problem or goal — and remind the user that you are trying to test the prototypes, not the users. Take notes as they use each of your prototypes. When they are done, talk with them more holistically about the three prototypes. Find out what resonated with each prototype relative to the others, and what missed the mark. While you hear them share usability feedback with you, usability isn't your focus right now. Your primary goal is to gain insight into the broader design space and your general design ideas. Are they hitting on real needs? Are they helpful but incremental?</p>

                    <p>Write up a summary of your findings. First, describe your method and who you tested with. Second, tell us what you saw. Third, tell us your interpretation and reflections. What did the feedback imply about your original design questions that led to the prototypes? What changes will it prompt? Focus on concept, not usability.</p>

                <div id="reflect" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Reflect, iterate, and choose an idea for P4</h2>
                    <p>Armed with your results from needfinding with prototypes, it's time to iterate.</p>

                    <p>First, reflect on the needs and How Might We questions you previously identified. Which ones do you no longer think are important or relevant? What are new ones you might not have see previously? Focusing, which one do you want to solve?</p>

                    <p>Second, reflect on your ideas. Flare again. Use your new experiences to brainstorm additional ideas around your revised How Might We question. What new ideas come up? Which old ones should be amended? Can you revive or splice old ideas in interesting ways?</p>

                    <p>Finally, work with your group to identify the one idea you are proposing to pursue for P4. Sketch it out clearly so that others in your studio can understand what need you are addressing, what the concept will do, and why it will address the need. You may use any medium you'd like for capturing your idea, but a well-executed sketch and storyboard in your sketchbook would likely be appropriate. <em>We will be taking this proposal very seriously and critiquing it, since it sets the stage for P4.</em></p>

Now is a good time for you and everyone else on the team to take a moment to privately evaluate how the team is doing. Is everyone pulling their weight? Are the collaborations effective? Are communication channels open?</p>

                    <p>Everyone must fill out our <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/Y2UxyVty6K">Team Dynamics Check-in</a> along with their milestone. If things could be going better, this gives us as staff a chance to step in and help.</p>
